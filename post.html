            <h2>I love you</h2>
            <span class="time">May 28</span>
            <quote>I love you — and <i>I love us together</i>.</quote>
            <p>The day we met is one of the best days of my life, as on that day I found my best friend for life. It is true, I was skeptical in the beginning, but you made me feel so loved and comfortable, that I cannot imagine a life without you. Now, I genuinely feel I am the luckiest girl on earth, for I have a man like you.</p>
            <p>Your love is always on my mind. When I am away from you, I long to feel your touch, the warmth of your hand, the comfort of your arms, and the soft touch of your lips on mine. You make me so very happy. The more time I spend with you, the more I find myself falling deeper in love with you. I love you—and I love us together.</p>
            <p>You are the man beyond my dreams: the man I wanted to marry, the man I would marry again, the first one I think about when I wake up, and the last one I think about when I go to bed. Thank you for being there with me through the very thick and thin moments of life. I cannot imagine my life without you.</p>
            <p>The responsibilities of marriage: being a good wife and a caring mother, were never a burden on my shoulder because your strong shoulders were always there to support me. I love you!</p>
